## Cloning Quarto website

After completing my *web dev (simple) stack refresher* with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web), I want to take on my first project and build website in the style of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

### Structure

The *Quarto-style* has:
- an `header` that shows the sections of the site
- a `sidebar` for navigating the current section
- another `sidebar` for navigating the reading on display
- a `middle-body` that represent the actual reading
- at the end, `left/right arrows` for switching to the previous/next reading
- at the very bottom, `footer` for social, trademarkd, ...
